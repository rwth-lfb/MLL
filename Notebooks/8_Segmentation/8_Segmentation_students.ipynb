It contains 20 classes, and you used it to detect the presence of classes such as \"person\" or \"bird\" in your images. Apart from the mere presence of classes, PASCAL VOC also contains information about where exactly in the image the classes are present in the form of segmentation masks. Today, you will learn how to perform segmentations using Deep Learning.\n",
