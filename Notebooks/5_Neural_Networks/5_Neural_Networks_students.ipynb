    "The centerpiece is the `Network` class which we use to represent a neural network. The following cell starts to implement the network object by defining the `__init__(self, ...)` method that is the constructor of the class and initializes the member variables. The biases and weights in the Network object are all initialized randomly using a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. This random initialization gives our stochastic gradient descent algorithm a place to start from.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list `sizes`, which contains the number of neurons in the respective layers of the network, is given as a parameter.  For example, if the list was `[2, 3, 1]`, then it would be a three-layer network with the first layer containing 2 neurons, the second layer 3 neurons, and the third layer 1 neuron. \n",

The biases for the network are initialized randomly, using a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. Note that the first layer is assumed to be an input layer, and by convention we won't set any biases for those neurons, since biases are only ever used in computing the outputs from preceding layers.\n",

So for example `self.weights[1]` is a NumPy matrix storing the weights connecting the second and third layers of neurons. (It's not the first and second layers, since Python's list indexing starts at 0.) Since `self.weights[1]` is rather verbose, let's just denote that matrix $w$. It's a matrix such that $w_{jk}$ is the weight for the connection between the $k$-th neuron in the second layer, and the $j$-th neuron in the third layer. \n",
